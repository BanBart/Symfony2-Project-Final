LineOfWork - Symfony2 Project.
================================================================================

I have developed this project in college, main reason was to obtain some skills 
in PHP, Symfony2 and javascript programming. 

It was my first project in which, i have tried web development.

It's not a finished one, and will probably never be finished.
