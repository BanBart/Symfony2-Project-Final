LineOfWork - Symfony2 Project.
================================================================================

I have developed this project in college, main reason was to obtain some skills 
in PHP, Symfony2 and javascript programming. 

It was my first project in which, i have tried web development.

It's not a finished one, and will probably never be finished.

->Register/login with email confirmation, also password change. I used
FOSUserBundle

->Login via AJAX technology if javascript is enabled.

->Internationalization currently only en and a few words in polish(check navbar,
when u switch to pl language to notice a change ;)

->A little javascript, u can found it at slogan, it should animate with 10s
latency.

->Admin panel which was implemented thanks to SonataAdminBundle.

->Commercial also is changing over time(10s), every request via AJAX,a new 
record(random one) from database is fetched and is replaced in html.
